Creating a service to sync the World ID Merkle tree involves several components and steps. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how you can build such a service:

### 1. Understanding the Components
- **World ID Merkle Tree:** This is a tree structure used to maintain user identity proofs on the Worldcoin protocol.
- **State Bridge Contracts:** These are used to fetch and propagate the latest Merkle tree root across different blockchain layers (L1 and L2).

### 2. Key Requirements
- **Service to Sync Merkle Tree:** This can be done using a sequencer that fetches and updates the Merkle tree root periodically.
- **EVM Support:** The target L2 blockchain should be EVM-compatible and support necessary cryptographic functions.
- **L1<>L2 Messaging Layer:** Use native messaging layers like Optimism cross-domain messenger or Arbitrum for communication between L1 and L2.
- **Relayer Service:** This periodically calls the `propagateRoot()` function to update the Merkle tree root on the target blockchain.
- **Deployment Scripts and Audits:** Scripts for deploying contracts and performing security audits are essential  [Github](https://github.com/dragan2234/worldcoin-scroll-bridge) [Github](https://github.com/worldcoin/semaphore-mtb-setup).

### 3. Implementation Steps

#### A. Setting Up the Contracts
1. **Deploy the Mainnet Contract:** Deploy a contract on Ethereum mainnet that fetches the latest Merkle tree root using a method like `latestRoot()`.
2. **Deploy the L2 Contract:** Deploy a corresponding contract on the L2 blockchain that will receive the Merkle tree root.

#### B. Synchronizing the Merkle Tree
1. **Fetch the Latest Root:** Use the mainnet contract to fetch the latest root of the Merkle tree.
2. **Propagate the Root:** Use the L1<>L2 messaging layer to send the latest root to the L2 contract.
3. **Update the L2 Contract:** The L2 contract updates its state with the new Merkle tree root.

#### C. Setting Up a Relayer Service
1. **Automate Root Propagation:** Set up a cron job or other scheduling service to periodically call the `propagateRoot()` function.
2. **Use a Reliable Node Service:** Ensure the relayer is running on a reliable node service to avoid downtime.

#### D. Building a Merkle Tree Explorer (Optional)
1. **Frontend Development:** Create a frontend to visualize the Merkle tree and its updates.
2. **Backend Sync:** Implement a backend service to sync the Merkle tree state with the on-chain data, possibly using an API like Etherscan for fetching on-chain data(Github)[https://github.com/diamondpawsinc/wld-merkle-tree-explorer].

### 4. Tools and Libraries
- **Semaphore Library:** For managing Merkle tree batches and generating proofs.
- **Golang and SNARK Tools:** For setting up cryptographic proofs and trusted setup ceremonies(Github)[https://github.com/worldcoin/semaphore-mtb-setup].

By following these steps and using the mentioned tools and libraries, you can build a service to effectively sync the World ID Merkle tree. This will help ensure that your application can maintain an up-to-date state and verify user identities securely and efficiently.
