## Creating a Service to Sync the World ID Merkle Tree

### Overview

To create a service to sync the World ID Merkle tree, currently managed by the signup-sequencer, you need to implement a system that can periodically fetch and propagate the latest Merkle tree root from the World ID Identity Manager to your target Layer 2 (L2) network. This will ensure that the L2 network can correctly verify proofs of inclusion, maintaining the integrity and functionality of the World ID system across multiple blockchain layers.

### Understanding the Current System

The World ID system involves several components that manage and update the Merkle tree of identities:

1. *WorldIdIdentityManager Contract*: This Ethereum smart contract maintains the Merkle tree of identities. The signup-sequencer periodically updates this tree by adding new identities.
2. *Signup-Sequencer*: A centralized service that processes identity commitments, updates the Merkle tree, and ensures synchronization between the blockchain and the database.

The goal is to propagate the updated Merkle tree root to an L2 network, enabling proof verification on that network.

### Requirements

1. *EVM Compatibility*: The target L2 network must be EVM-compatible and support cryptographic precompiles like keccak256 and pairing (ECC).
2. *Cross-Domain Messaging*: Utilize native L1<>L2 messaging layers such as Optimism’s CrossDomainMessenger, Scroll’s ScrollMessenger, or Arbitrum’s Inbox to propagate the Merkle tree root.
3. *Periodic Root Propagation*: Implement a service that periodically calls the propagateRoot() function to update the L2 network with the latest Merkle tree root.

### Service Components

1. *Root Fetcher*: A component that interacts with the WorldIdIdentityManager contract on Ethereum to fetch the latest Merkle tree root using the latestRoot() method.
2. *Root Propagator*: A component that sends the fetched root to the L2 network using the native cross-domain messaging layer. This involves calling the appropriate function (e.g., receiveRoot()) on the target L2 contract.
3. *Scheduler*: A scheduler (e.g., cron job) to periodically trigger the Root Fetcher and Root Propagator to ensure the L2 network is always updated with the latest root.

### Implementation Steps

1. *Deploy Contracts*: Deploy the necessary state bridge contracts on Ethereum (L1) and your target L2 network. You can use existing implementations like OpStateBridge as templates.
   
2. *Develop the Sync Service*:
    - *Fetch the Latest Root*: Write a service (could be a simple Node.js or Python script) that calls the latestRoot() method on the WorldIdIdentityManager contract to get the current Merkle tree root.
    - *Propagate the Root*: Call the propagateRoot() method on the state bridge contract to send this root to the L2 network using the cross-domain messenger.

3. *Automate the Process*: Use a scheduler to periodically run your sync service. This ensures the Merkle tree root is continuously updated on the L2 network.

### Security and Audits

Ensure your contracts and sync service are secure by following best practices and undergoing audits. The Worldcoin project has undergone multiple audits for their smart contracts, and you should consider doing the same for your implementations.

### Tools and Resources

The Worldcoin team is developing a suite of tools, including a state-bridge-service and tree-availability-service, to facilitate root propagation and proof verification. These tools will be open-sourced soon and can be leveraged for your implementation.

### Detailed Guidance

1. *Clone and Understand Existing Repositories*: Examine the signup-sequencer and related repositories on GitHub to understand their structure and functionality.

2. *Set Up Local Development Environment*: Install necessary tools like Docker, Protobuf compiler, and a local Ethereum node (e.g., Geth or Ganache).

3. *Implement State Bridge*: Develop and deploy your own state bridge contracts for the desired chains. Use tools like Optimism's CrossDomainMessenger or similar mechanisms for other EVM-compatible chains.

4. *Automate Root Propagation*: Create a program that periodically calls the propagateRoot() function to update the Merkle root on the target chain. Ensure that inclusion proofs are generated and validated correctly.

5. *Visualize and Verify*: Use or extend existing Merkle Tree Explorers to visualize the tree and ensure the integrity and correctness of the data.

By following these steps, you can create a robust service to sync the World ID Merkle tree to your target L2 network, ensuring that proofs of inclusion can be correctly verified on the L2. For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the Worldcoin documentation and their GitHub repositories.
